# OCRmyPDF - API (using FastAPI)

API server for OCRmyPDF

[OCRmyPDF](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io) is a command line tool for applying Optical Character Recognition on PDF
documents. This project aims to provide a basic API to use OCRmyPDF as a server.

This was mainly done for use with [Paper Matter](https://gitlab.com/exotic-matter/ftl-app), an easy to use document
management system.

**Fair warning: this is work in progress project.**
